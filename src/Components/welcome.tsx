                    Welcome to your personal Degree Planner! Some basic tools
                    tools have been designed to make your visit accessible to
                    your needs; this includes creating new plans from scratch
                    and/or compiling data from a csv file. You will be able to
                    add, remove, edit, and save various courses/semesters in a
                    multitude of plans. Scroll to the bottom of the page for
                    more instructions (will enhance this later by making an
                    expandable/disposable button near the top of the page).
